The Silicon Labs Wi-Fi allows for a wide variety applications to be built on its foundation. This repo showcases some example applications using the Silicon Labs Wi-Fi.

This repository provides SLCP projects (as External Repositories).

## Examples ##

| No | Example name | Link to example |
|:--:|:-------------|:---------------:|
| 1  | Wi-Fi - Asset Tracking | [Click Here](./wifi_asset_tracking) |

## Requirements ##

1. Silicon Labs SiWx91x development kit
2. Simplicity Studio 5
3. Compatible GSDK version that specified in each project's readme file. You can install it via Simplicity Studio or download it from our GitHub [gecko_sdk](https://github.com/SiliconLabs/gecko_sdk)
4. Compatible WiSeConnect SDK version that specified in each project's readme file. You can install it via Simplicity Studio or download it from our GitHub [wiseconnect_sdk](https://github.com/SiliconLabs/wiseconnect)
5. Compatible Third-Party Hardware Drivers extension that also specified in each project's readme file, available [here](https://github.com/SiliconLabs/third_party_hw_drivers_extension)

## Working with Projects ##

1. To add an external repository, perform the following steps.

    - From Simpilicity Studio 5, go to **Preferences > Simplicity Studio > External Repos**. Here you can add the repo `https://github.com/SiliconLabs/wifi_applications.git`

    - Cloning and then selecting the branch, tag, or commit to add. The default branch is Master. This repo cloned to `<path_to_the_SimplicityStudio_v5>\developer\repos\`

2. From Launcher, select your device from the "Debug Adapters" on the left before creating a project. Then click the **EXAMPLE PROJECTS & DEMOS** tab -> check **wifi_applications** under **Provider** to show a list of Wi-Fi application example projects compatible with the selected device. Click CREATE on a project to generate a new application from the selected template.

## Porting to Another Board ##

To change the target board, navigate to Project -> Properties -> C/C++ Build -> Board/Part/SDK. Start typing in the Boards search box and locate the desired development board, then click Apply to change the project settings. Ensure that the board specifics include paths, found in Project -> Properties -> C/C++ General -> Paths and Symbols, correctly match the target board.

## Documentation ##

The official Wi-Fi documentation is available on the [Developer Documentation](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-developing-with-wiseconnect-sdk/) page.

## Reporting Bugs/Issues and Posting Questions and Comments ##

To report bugs in the Application Examples projects, please create a new "Issue" in the "Issues" section of this repo. Please reference the board, project, and source files associated with the bug, and reference line numbers. If you are proposing a fix, also include information on the proposed fix. Since these examples are provided as-is, there is no guarantee that these examples will be updated to fix these issues.

Questions and comments related to these examples should be made by creating a new "Issue" in the "Issues" section of this repo.
